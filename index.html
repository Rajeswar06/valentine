    I am truly in love with you Milan. My heart aches when i think that what if you can't be mine,
    from the past few days onwards I am only thinking about you I am completely distracted. I fear that I will
    get struck with you if you leave me and I feel like I will be lost. I don't know how to say this
    feeling but I am not sure if you truly love me or not. My hope towards you is at its peaks
    and still rising, I just want a clarification that if I can still fall for you with a hope that you
    will be mine or should I be out of it before I get lost. you are the only one in my thoughts now I
    can't focus on anything for real. I want a a single reply from you, Is it right for me to wait for you until you become the person you aspire to be?<br>
    Will you be my valentine forever?
